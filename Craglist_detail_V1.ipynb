It's a very nice complex, where rent would be around $1500-1700 each. \\nI'm 26/m and am pretty laid back and easy to get along with. If you're interested we could skype or something to see if it would be a good fit, and if so go take a tour of the apartment. \\nThey have a few different rooms available that you're welcome to check out on their website. It's a very new and nice complex, right next to a park.
