I definitely welcome great conversation and dining together, feel free to ask and talk with me anytime. I also understand if you have a busy agenda and need to take care of your endeavors in solitude - I respect this either way.
I was a student at Stanford and Berkeley and also a co-founder of a VR startup. I will usually come home pretty late, but sometimes I also work at home for the whole day. I reside in the master bedroom and I enjoy meeting people. I have had the pleasure of hosting over 30 guests from all over the world and have immensely enjoyed meeting them and even worked closely on projects together!
